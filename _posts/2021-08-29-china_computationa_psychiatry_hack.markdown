The 1st Computational Psychiatry Hack @ China is jointly organized by the Chinese Computational Psychiatry Network (CCPN), the Sophon Academy and Heywhale. In this program, the participants will join as a team to learn computational modeling. They will reproduce the analysis of a published paper in the computational psychiatry (CP) [1], under the guidance of experienced experts. All the participants will have a precious experience to know the CP field by doing a completed project with teammates and chance to win impressive scholarships! 

The slogan is ‘Get hands dirty, learn by doing!’.
