Description: The Sprint AI Training for African Medical Imaging
Knowledge Translation (SPARK) Academy is a case-based training program
designed to empower African researchers with the skills to create and
implement AI tools for medical diagnostics. The first SPARK Academy will
guide 70 trainees from various cities across Africa through steps to
develop state-of-the-art AI methods for brain tumor segmentation and
enable up to 10 teams from this cohort to participate in the MICCAI 2023
Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge. The top 3 teams from Africa
will win monetary prizes (up to $5000 per team).
We will offer a training facility for this hackathon and provide meals
during the full-day events. All live training events are in East Africa
Time (EAT).
