Aim of the event
Neuroscience Alliance is a nonprofit organisation that works like a Brainhack and aims to promote interaction between scientists, developers, and artists interested in the brain. Questions may evolve around the study of brain anatomy and function using non-invasive imaging methods (e.g., MRI, EEG, MEG) and intraoperative brain mapping methods, or post-mortem dissection of the evolution of nervous systems across species, variability of brain characteristics in healthy participants, the insurgency of brain pathologies, and there is no limit to artistic reflections in any form.
Participants can bring their dataset, discuss a project, and recruit a team of collaborators on-site. Access to large, free online databases of MRI images will also be available throughout the three days to test new creative ideas.
The workshop, which incorporates all levels of expertise, is also an opportunity to learn methods, develop skills and collaborate with other participants.
