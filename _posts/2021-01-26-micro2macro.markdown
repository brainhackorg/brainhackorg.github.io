Description: The Brainhack Micro2Macro 2021 is an official satellite event of the International Global Brainhack 2020.
The goal of this hackathon is to bring together researchers with disparate backgrounds to collaborate on open science 
projects in neuroimaging, with a focus on the link between brain macrostructure and microstructure. The event will 
take place virtually, we symbolically picked the fictional Atlantis as our venue since the main sessions will take 
place between 2PM and 6PM UTC, making suitable for people based both in Africa, Europe and the East Coast of the 
Americas to attend. Any other time during the event can be dedicated to hacking!
