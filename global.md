# BrainHack Global

BrainHack Global (BHG) is a hackathon consisting of multiple local events in different
regions around the world run towards the end of the year November ~ December. A central
project submission website (see [BrainHack Global 2023](https://brainhack.org/global2023/projects/\))
can be used to coordinate projects across event sites. If you are planning to host a
hackathon in your region around this time and would like to loosely coordinate with
other hackathons going on at the same time please add your event to the
[BrainHack Global 2024 events list](https://brainhack.org/global2024/events/).
